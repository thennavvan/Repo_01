Create a professional, single-page portfolio management web application called "BigBull Portfolio Management" that functions as a complete asset tracking and trading dashboard similar to Groww. The entire application should be contained in a single HTML file with embedded CSS and JavaScript, featuring a modern, eye-catching yet subtle design with smooth animations and transitions.
The application should have a clean, professional color scheme using blues for primary actions, greens for profits and buy actions, reds for losses and sell actions, and a light gray background with white cards that have subtle shadows. Use a modern sans-serif font like Inter or Roboto throughout the interface. The design must be fully responsive and work seamlessly across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
The main dashboard page should start with a prominent header displaying the portfolio name "BigBull Portfolio Management" in bold, professional typography. Directly below the header, display the total wallet balance in large, clear numbers with a currency symbol. Below the wallet balance, include three primary action buttons arranged horizontally: Assets, Transactions, and Search. These buttons should be styled as prominent call-to-action elements with hover effects.
In the center-left section of the main page, create a wallet information card that displays the wallet ID and current balance. This card should have a clean white background with rounded corners and a subtle shadow. The balance displayed here should update dynamically whenever any buy or sell transaction occurs. Include a small timestamp showing when the balance was last updated.
Below the wallet card, create an assets preview section that displays all currently owned assets as individual cards arranged in a grid layout. For example, if the user owns Bitcoin and Reliance stock, each should appear as a separate card. Each asset card should prominently display the asset symbol at the top, the full asset name below it, the current total value of holdings in that asset, and a "View More" button at the bottom of the card. The cards should have hover effects that slightly elevate them to indicate interactivity.
On the right side of the main dashboard, create a sidebar that contains two main components. At the top, display a colorful pie chart that visualizes the portfolio allocation, showing what percentage of the total portfolio value each asset represents. Use distinct colors for each asset slice and include a legend that maps colors to asset names. Below the pie chart, create a recommendations panel titled "Top 5 Assets of the Day" that displays five recommended assets with their symbols and brief performance statistics like current price and daily percentage change.
When a user clicks the "View More" button on any asset card, the application should transition to a detailed asset page. This page should have a prominent header section displaying the asset symbol and full name in large text. Directly below, show the current live price of the asset, the number of units owned by the user, and the profit or loss percentage. The profit/loss should be color-coded green for gains and red for losses, with an upward or downward arrow icon.
Below the header information, create two prominent action buttons: Buy and Sell. When either button is clicked, open a modal or expand an inline form that allows the user to enter the number of units they want to buy or sell. This transaction form should display several calculated fields: the units input field where the user enters the quantity, the current price per unit fetched in real-time, the total payable amount calculated by multiplying units by current price, and the resulting wallet balance after the transaction. Include proper validation that shows an error message if the user attempts to buy more than their wallet balance allows or sell more units than they own. Add a confirm button and a cancel button to complete or abort the transaction.
Below the transaction controls, embed a large candlestick chart that displays historical price data for the asset. Above the chart, provide time period selector buttons that allow users to choose different time ranges: 3 days, 5 days, 10 days, 15 days, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months. When a user clicks any time period button, the chart should update to display data for that specific timeframe. The candlestick chart should show open, high, low, and close prices with red candles for days when price decreased and green candles for days when price increased.
Below the candlestick chart, add additional visualization sections including a volume chart showing trading volume over time, trend indicators with moving averages, and other relevant technical indicators presented in card format with clear labels and color-coded values.
Create a risk analysis section that fetches data from the server and displays risk metrics in an organized card layout. Show metrics like volatility, beta, maximum drawdown, and risk rating with appropriate visual indicators like progress bars or gauge charts. Use color coding where high risk appears in red, moderate risk in yellow, and low risk in green.
Add an insights section that presents key analytics about the asset including market cap, PE ratio, 52-week high and low, average volume, and other fundamental data points. Display these in a clean grid or list format with labels and values clearly separated.
Include a news section at the bottom of the asset detail page that displays the latest news articles related to the asset. Each news item should show the article title, a brief summary or excerpt, the publication source, and the timestamp. Fetch this news data from the server endpoint. Style the news items as cards with clear separation between each article.
Create a dedicated transactions history page that displays a comprehensive list of all past transactions. Each transaction entry should show the asset symbol, full asset name, number of units transacted, the price per unit at the time of transaction, a badge indicating whether it was a buy or sell transaction with color coding, and the exact date and time of the transaction. At the top of the transactions page, include sorting controls that allow users to sort the transaction list by asset name or by date and time, with options to sort in ascending or descending order. Implement these sorting controls as a dropdown menu or toggle buttons.
Implement a search functionality that appears when the user clicks the Search button in the main header. The search should feature an autocomplete input field that shows suggestions as the user types. Display all available assets in a dropdown that appears below the search field, filtering the list based on the user's input. When the user selects an asset from the suggestions, check if the asset is already owned. If the asset is in the portfolio, navigate directly to the detailed asset page described earlier. If the asset is not owned, display a new asset exploration page.
The new asset exploration page should show the asset symbol and name at the top, the current market price prominently displayed, a historical price chart showing past performance, a news section with latest articles about the asset, and a Buy button. When the user clicks the Buy button on an unowned asset, show the same transaction form described earlier allowing them to specify units, see the calculated payable amount, check their wallet balance, and confirm the purchase. Upon successful purchase of a new asset, automatically add it to the user's assets section on the main dashboard.
Structure the JavaScript code to handle state management for the wallet balance and owned assets. Implement functions to fetch data from API endpoints including wallet information, asset details, transaction history, search results, recommendations, news articles, risk analysis data, and historical price data. Create functions to handle buy and sell transactions that update the wallet balance, modify the units owned for each asset, and record the transaction in the history. Implement proper error handling for failed API calls with user-friendly error messages displayed as toast notifications or alert boxes.
Include loading states throughout the application that show spinners or skeleton screens while data is being fetched from the server. Implement form validation for all transaction inputs ensuring users cannot enter negative numbers, zero units, or non-numeric values. Add confirmation dialogs before executing any buy or sell transaction to prevent accidental trades.
Use modern CSS techniques like Flexbox and Grid for layouts, CSS transitions for smooth animations, and box shadows for depth. Implement hover effects on all interactive elements like buttons and cards. Add active states for buttons to provide feedback when clicked. Use a consistent spacing system throughout the application with standardized padding and margins.
Create a navigation system that allows seamless transitions between the main dashboard, asset detail pages, transaction history page, and search results page without page refreshes, functioning as a single-page application. Implement this using JavaScript to show and hide different sections or by manipulating the URL hash and responding to hash changes.
Include proper accessibility features such as semantic HTML elements, ARIA labels where needed, keyboard navigation support, and sufficient color contrast ratios. Ensure all interactive elements are focusable and have visible focus indicators.
The final deliverable should be a single, self-contained HTML file that can be opened in any modern web browser and function as a complete portfolio management system. Include sample data or mock API responses within the JavaScript to demonstrate all features working together. Add comments in the code explaining major sections and complex logic. Ensure the code is clean, well-organized, and follows best practices for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript development.
